# AdventureWorks DW 2019 Sales Data Analysis

In this data analyst project we explore AdventureWorks 2019 sample database.
We focus on the sales of the last two years, the products that have been sold and the clients.
Also we measure our numbers against the budget.

Tools used: SQL, Power BI

We use the Microsoft SQL Server to clean and extract the data we need in order to create three Power BI dashboards:
- Sales Overview Dashboard
- Customer Details Dashboard
- Product Details Dashboard
